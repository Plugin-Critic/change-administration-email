Change the Site's Administration Email Address on the General Settings page without the confirmation email.

== Description ==

Having trouble changing or confirming your Administration Email Address?

This plugin solves the problem where the confirmation email is not being sent (or delivered) making it impossible to confirm a new admin email.

Site administrators are provided a link to confirm the new email address directly on the General Settings page.

Because 7 is deprecated and I wanted to use match().

Because the plugin uses core functions to display notices that were added in version 6.4. If you need support for an older version of WordPress let me know at <https://plugincritic.com/contact/>.
